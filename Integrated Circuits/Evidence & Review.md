# Integrated Circuits

During the start of this semester I was able to create two different working circuits using an Integrated Circuit.

For the first Circuit, I created a flashing LED using a 555 timer IC and a semiconductor, this is much easier than using an extensive code via a microcontroller as it is all done with Analog Circuit and doesn't need a long repetitive "void loop ()" function that does it manually.

The second circuit used a IC and a microcontroller to have a line of LED's turn on in order then have all of the LED's turn off, this could be used as an output to let people know that something is loading in a machine with no screens or LCD displays.

For these circuits, although simple in design and being guided, it gave me a good understanding on how to use the IC's within circuits, this means in the future I will be able to create more complicated circuits either as a whole or being able to develop a complicated circuit with minimal microcontroller input.

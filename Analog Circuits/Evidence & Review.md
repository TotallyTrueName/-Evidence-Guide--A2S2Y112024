During my Learning this semester I developed skills not only for making functioning prototypes with code and micro controllers, but I have also learned to make Analog Circuits with the use of Logic Gates, made with transistors to create logic without the need of a microcontroller.

This semester I have developed the ability to create independent Analog Circuits, a example of this is the first Assessment this term. I was able to create functioning designs that could be used within a real life scenario to help create a secure way to control a needed part of many industries.

Within this Assignment i created a functioning prototype with LED's as a output source, having all logic controlled by transistors within two differing types of analog logic gates

In Exhibit A there is a Tinkercad Digital prototype, this was based on Exhibit B, B being an online logic gate diagram.

The two aforementioned Prototypes lead to a physical breadboard circuit that worked independently of any micro controller or code, the transistors either acting as a and gate where two inputs lead to a single output, or a or gate where any input leads to an output. Having a Analog Circuit is needed for some cases where technology is used as the coding is not always going to be available or the code can be a hindrance for safety as the code can be long and difficult to fully check over for maintenance.
Below is Exhibit C, a photo of the final design that was created.

Reviewing the design, I believe that there is many steps I could take to clean the design and make it simpler, possibly removing wires or resistors to make the design simpler, however this is something I will be developing the ability to do while creating the prototype in the future.

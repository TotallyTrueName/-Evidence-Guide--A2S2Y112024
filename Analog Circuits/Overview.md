During my Learning this semester I developed skills not only for making functioning prototypes with code and micro controllers, but I have also learned to make Analog Circuits with the use of Logic Gates, made with transistors to create logic without the need of a micro controller.

Within this folder there is also unsorted images of Analog circuits, either physical or digital via a diagram website or Tinkercad

Over the last two Semesters I have learned a basic understanding of the inner workings of technology and how they work, along with 
this I have been able to understand coding to a basic level, meaning im able to create simple circuits with both micro controllers and logic 
gates/IC's.

This Semester I have been able to develop my skills and understanding of the circuits, meaning I have developed not only the ability to create a circuit with the use of a microcontroller, but I have learned to create independent circuits that run on only power sources.

This Github repository has 3 folders, Analog Circuits, Integrated circuits, and Laws around circuits respectively.
These folders contain a file for evidence and justification for the learning and a file for review on the learning.
some might have unsorted photos, videos or code as evidence, they will be mentioned and named as Exhibit A etc.

Over this Semester and last Semester I have learned a basic understanding of the inner workings of technology and how they work, along with 
this I have been able to understand coding to a basic level, meaning im able to create simple circuits with both micro controllers and logic 
gates.

This Semester I have been able to develop my skills and understanding of the integrated circuits along with developing my cleanliness while 
making different iterations of differing circuits, this is a great help as it will allow others to help either build off my design or help 
me fix any problems that might arise with the bread board designs we have been creating in class.

This Github repository has 3 folders, Intergradted circuits, Prototyping, and (Place holder) respectivly.
These folders contain a file for evidence and justification for the learning and a file for review on the learning.
some might have unsorted photos, videos or code as evidence, they will be mentioned and named as Exibit A etc.

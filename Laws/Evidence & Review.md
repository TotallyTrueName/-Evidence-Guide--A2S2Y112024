This Semester I learned about different laws that help to dictate the way that circuits work and help to create functioning designs or prototypes with lessened accidents or burned out LED/Burst capacitors.

The first law that we learned about is Kirchhoff's law, this law states that 
"The algebraic sum of all the voltages around any closed loop in a circuit is equal to zero."
This basically says that the amount of energy that enters a circuit will be the same amount leaving the circuit, as when energy cant be created or destroyed.
However energy can change forms, this comes into effect within circuits when too much energy is put into a circuit, if you are putting too much energy into a circuit or not enough energy the amount of voltage will not raise or lower on its own to adjust to the resistance of the different components.

This semester I was able to engrain this law into my prototypes by using more resistors to help prevent damaging components and having an equal input to output voltage.

This can be seen in comparison from my Analog circuit compared to my original prototypes for past projects. Within these designs I made little to no attempt to adjust the input current meaning that the circuits were ineffective and would likely have issues with each component as the components aren't designed to have that much voltage entering them.

Exhibit A

Exhibit B


However during this semester I've developed to having effective resistor usage and managing voltage input meaning I'm able to create more effective designs. An example of this is the Analog circuit below.

Exhibit C (Analog Circuit)
